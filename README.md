Here's a suggested structure for your **README.md** file for the Algorithm Visualizer project:

# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web application that allows users to explore and visualize various algorithms, including sorting and searching techniques. It provides an intuitive graphical representation of how each algorithm works, along with details such as pseudocode, time complexity, and space complexity.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Graphical representation of algorithm execution step by step.
- **Color Representations**: Each color represents a specific action in the algorithm (e.g., comparison, insertion, sorted).
- **Algorithm Details**: Information on time complexity, space complexity, and pseudocode.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the visualization speed using a slider.
- **Filter and Search**: Filter algorithms by category (e.g., sorting, searching) or search for a specific algorithm.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes and devices.

## Algorithms Available
### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Color Representation
Each algorithm uses specific colors to represent key actions. Here's what each color means:

- **Red**: Elements being compared.
- **Green**: Final sorted or target elements.
- **Yellow**: Pivot elements or current element being evaluated.
- **Blue**: Reset or default state of the elements.

## How to Use
1. Select an algorithm from the **Home Page**.
2. Click on the **Visualize** button to see the algorithm in action.
3. Use the **Start** button to begin the visualization.
4. Use the **Reset** button to reset the bars.
5. Adjust the **Speed Slider** to control the speed of the animation.

## Installation
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## File Structure
- **index.html**: The main page with a list of algorithms.
- **visualization.html**: The page where algorithm visualizations occur.
- **style.css**: Styling for the project.
- **script.js**: Logic for the home page.
- **visualization.js**: Algorithm implementation and visualization logic.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive and dynamic elements.
